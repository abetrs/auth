# auth (not done yet).
I tried making an auth system with Node.js, Express.js, JWT, bcrypt, and Vue.js with MongoDB as my database and Mongoose as the ORM.
Feel free to look around!

How to get started:
1. Clone this git repository:
  ```git
  git clone https://github.com/abetrs/auth.git --depth=3
  ```
2. Install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:
  ```bash
  cd ./backend
  yarn
  cd ../frontend
  yarn
  ```
3. Run both servers:
  ```bash
  cd ./backend
  yarn run dev
  (in other terminal)
  cd ./frontend
  yarn run serve
  ```
  After messing around be sure to give me feedback on how to improve it!
